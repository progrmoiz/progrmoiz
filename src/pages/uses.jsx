            <Tool title="13” MacBook Pro, M1, 8GB RAM (2020)">
              This is my main laptop. The new M1 chips are amazing, and I’ve been extremely impressed with the performance of this little machine.

            <Tool title="Intel Core i3-4160, 12GB RAM, Nvidia GTX 750Ti">
              This is my desktop PC. It’s nothing fancy, but it gets the job done. I don’t do any gaming or video editing, so I don’t need a ton of horsepower.

            <Tool title="Visual Studio Code">
              This is my go-to code editor. It’s fast, has great plugin support, and is constantly being improved. I loved using Sublime Text in the past, but VS Code has won me over.

            <Tool title="Figma">
              I started using Figma just for design work, but it’s quickly become my go-to tool for everything. The collaboration features are amazing - I can’t recommend it enough!
            </Tool>
            <Tool title="Canva">
              I use Canva for all of my design work. It’s simple, easy to use, and has a ton of templates and assets to help you get started.

          <ToolsSection title="Productivity">
            <Tool title="Google Calendar">
              I try to stay as organized as possible, and Google Calendar is my tool of choice. I use it to track my work schedule, appointments, and deadlines.
            </Tool>
            <Tool title="Notion">
              Notion is my second brain. I use it for everything from project management to taking notes. It’s an extremely powerful tool, and I can’t recommend it enough.
            </Tool>
            <Tool title="Yaara AI">
              I recently started using Yaara AI, and it’s quickly become one of my favorite tools. It helps me write better and more engaging content.
